Q1. What is class in  java & write the class templates? 

class is the java defination Block wehich is used to define the state and behaviour 
of an object.
in class state represent the charecterstics of an object where behaviour represent the
functionality of an object.

>> When we create multiple objects of a class , all the objects have some states
behaviour but difference in values.
>> Class is the group of Onject which have common properties , it kind of like blueprint
or template frim which the objects are created.
>> In java , to crate a class we use the keyword class , which is reserved keyword in java,

class className{
    // data_members
    // methods
}

Q2. What is object in java ? 

>> object is basically a real time entity, runtime entity, or an instatnce
of a class which has its state and behaviour.
state can be refered as data_members and behaviour can be refered as methods.

>> there are three ways of initilizing the object. 
1. by using reference variable 
2. By using method
3. by using constructor.

>by using reference variable, 
lets take one example , 

class Student{
    public static int id;
    public staic String name;

}

class Main{
    public staic void main(String [] args){
        Student st = new Student(); // st is a reference variable.
        st.name = "sundar";
        st.id = "1234"; // initilizing object via reference variable.
    }
}

>by using constructor;
lets take one example , 

class Student{
    public static int id;
    public staic String name;
    Student(int id , String name){
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Main{
    public staic void main(String [] args){
        Student st = new Student(234, "sundar"); // st is a reference variable.
        // Student() is the parameterized constructor.
    }
}


>>by using methods;
lets take one example , 

class Student{
    public static int id;
    public staic String name;

    public void initilize_Record(int id_ , String name_){
        this.id = id_;
        this.name = name_;
    }
}

class Main{
    public staic void main(String [] args){
        Student st = new Student();
        st.initilize_Record(123, "sundar");
    }
}
>> While creating the object, object gets created the memory in the heap memory area , the reference
variable refers to the object allocated in hte heap memory area.here st is the reference variable which is stored
in the stack memory and that refers to the objects allocated memory.


Q3. What is byte code file? How many
 byte code files will be generated after 
 compiling source file?

 ans : The class file , object file and the exe file generated after the
 succssfull compilation of the java program is called the byte code file.

 program.java
 javac program.java

 here javac is the Compiler for the java and after the compilation of
 the java file , there will be additional class file called

 >>program.class , is call the bytecode
 >> Bytecode generally a instructons set for the java virtual Machine.
 with the help of byte code file we can acheive the platrorm independence
 in java.


 After the succssfull compilation of the java program , the byte code will be
 generated and then the bytecode is now ready to seve to the java virtual Machine
 or bassically an execution of a progarm we call it as , 

 platrorm independence java --> Means the execution of java program is not strictly
 limited to one platrorm or in operating system. if the system have the basic java
 installation or by means it has the JVM then we can execuete java program in any platform.\

4 . What will be the name of the bytecode file ???

>> the name of the bytecode file will be same name as className and then the extensioons 
might be .classs.

5. Command used to compile and execute the java progarm. ?? 

Progarm : Hello.java

>> javac Hello.java
>> java Hello 

<<< here the javac is the compiler.  first line is used to compile the java program
if there are any error it will trhrow an error in the console ortherwise the cursor just
move down and we can make use of another command 
java Hello // which is basically a execution of the program.

5. Can I declare the local variable  as static ?? 

>> No we cant , The varaiable which has its scope inside the one particular
method only or inside the curley braces is called the local variable, so we can not declare the local 
variable as the static, it will throw an Compilation Error, by saying Illegeal Start of an expressoon, only final is alowed.


6. Does Java Allows global variable ?? 

>> Java Does not support the concept of Global variable implicitly ,
>> Global varaiable are those varaiable that can be accessed from all the classes,

we need to craete a class and global variables can be part of this class, 
can use static variable to create a global variable since static varaiable belong to class and it can be accessed
across all instatnce of the class.

7. How Many types of variable does java supports ?? 

>>  variable is the container which holds the value when progarm is executed.
A variable is assigned with the data type. and the value of the variable can be chanegd.

varaiable is simply the name of the memory location: 
>> There are 3 types of variable in java 
1. local variable

>> local variable are declared inside the methods , an local variable cannot be declare as static.

>> int sum = 50;
   // here sum is the variable and the value assigned to it is 50 , the data type is integer. 


2. instatnce variable

>> Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block.
>> When instance variable is declared in a class these varaiable are created when an object of the 
class is created and destryed when the object is destryed.

>> initilizion of the instance varaiable is not mandatory , its defalut vakue is 0 for int , null for String
and empty for the char and false for the boolean;

class A {
    public int a = 10; // insatnce variable
    public static void main(String [] args){
        A obj = new A();
        System.out.println(obj.a); // 10
    }
}


3. static varaiable.
>> static varaiable are also known as the class variables.

>> static varaiable are the varaiable which are declare inside the class outside the constructor or methods,
for the static variable it is mandatory to use the static keyword at the begening of the datatype.

>> static varaiable are created at the statrt of execution of the program and destryed automatically when
execution ends.

>> static variable can be acessed with the className or with the object of the class Name.

public class test {
    static int x = 59;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(test.x);
        
    } 
}

8. How to access static & non static members explain with an example. 

>> accessing static data members
1. by using className if the main method is in the same class otherwise we have to create the object of the class to acceess
the data members and the methods of the another class.
2. by creating object of the className


>> here we are trying to access the proporties of the class A , from the main methhod which is in same class, 
we can directly call it using clas Name.

public class test {
    static int x = 59;
    public static void print(){
        // code
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(test.x);
        test.print(); // access the print method.
        
    } 
}

>> if we want to acces the proporties of anotehr class then we have to crate the object of another class 
and then through this object we can access the data members of anoter class.

example: 

class A{
    static int x = 10; // static variable
    public int y = 34; // instatnce varible

    public void print(){
        System.out.println("print method");
    }

    public static int method_name(){
        return 1;
    }
}

class test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        A obj = new A();
        System.out.println(obj.x);
        System.out.println(obj.y);
        obj.print();
        obj.method_name();
    } 
}


Q. When to declare data members as static and non static ?? 



>> static data members and functions can be accessed in static members as well as non static members functions.
& and static variable acts as the global variable, and static variable occupies less space in memory
because the memory allocation happens once when the object is created.

>> non static data members can not be acessed within static data member functions , and non static variable 
are specefic to instatnce object in which they are created , a non static varaiable may occupy more space 
since the memory allocation happen in run time.



public class JavaTester {
   public int counter = 0; // non staic varaiable
   public static int staticCounter = 0; // static variable.
   public JavaTester(){
      counter++;
      staticCounter++;
   }
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      JavaTester tester = new JavaTester();
      JavaTester tester1 = new JavaTester();
      JavaTester tester2 = new JavaTester();
      System.out.println("Counter: " + tester2.counter);
      System.out.println("Static Counter: " + tester2.staticCounter);
   }
}


Output
-----------
Counter: 1
Static Counter: 3


to decide when to declare static and non static data members
------------------------------------------------------------

if we want to represent the individual information like name , id
phone number , marks then they must be declared as non static.

>> if we want to represent the common information like city branch,
college name , then they must declared as static.

>> the memory allocation for the static variable is less as compared to
non static data members.


Blocks
--------

1. what is block and how many blocks are available in java? 

>> Block is the group of several statmemts , can be single or nested state
ments.
in java there are two types of blocks 
> static block 
> non sttaic block

2. diffrece between the block and the method.
>> well, the first the block doesnot have any specefic name while the method must have, 
and the block does not have any return type and method must have any return type, and Blocks are executed
automatically while to execute the method we have to call it explicitly.

3. When does the Static blocl will Execute ? 
ans >> The static block will execute at the time of class Loading.

4. When the non static Block will get executed ? 

ans : the non static block will execuete at the time of object cration, after the execution
of static blocks.

5. How many times the satic block will execute?

>> Since the class Loading happens only once, the execution of the static block
happens only once.

6. How Many times the non static block will get execute ?? 

>> the execution  times is strictly depends upon the number of object being created
of the class.

7. Can i initilize static data members inside non static block? 

ans : Yes , we can use.


8. can i initilize non static mem inside static block ?

// no we cant , it gives the compilation error.
