basic java
----------
what is java ? 
>> java is a high level, robust , secure and object oriented
programming language.it was developed by sum microsystem in the year
of 1995.and later it was aquired by the Oracle. The java is used to
int the sector of  Standalone applications,web applications,Mobile applications, 
and enterprise applications.


why java is called object oriented programming language ?

>>  As the term object oriented programming or oops refers to the language 
that uses the objects in the programming, and the object oriented programming aims to
implement the real world entities like inheritence , abstractions and encapsultion,
so it is impossible to write a java source code without objects, so that the java is 
refered as object oriented programming language.

Why java is called platform independent? 

>> java is platrorm independent beccause the bytecode file or class file which is 
genereated after the succssfull compilation of java source code can run in any
operating system in the presence of java virtual machine, it means the system must have
the basic java installation.it is because the byte code is a non executable code, to 
execute this code we heed to have a java interpreter , which is provided by the JVM.



java virtual Machine
--------------------

>> it is a virtual machine, which perform the task like the machine without having any
physical existance.
>> the task of the jvm is to process the bytecocde file to the processor for the
execution.


java runtime envirounemnt
--------------------------
>> it is the software which is responsible for providing the necessary envirounemnt
or resources to the jvm, so that the jvm can perform its operation without being intrupted.

JIT
-----
>> Along with javac , JIT is an additional compiler which are responsible for]
line by line execution of the executable file and it also responsible for converting 
the bytecode file to configruation file.

java development kit
---------------------
>> it is a java development kit , which is responsible for providing necessary 
components that are required to compile and execuete the java program.

>> inside jdk there  are compilers , java virtual machine and java runtime envirounemnt.



Keywords
--------------

keywords are the set of predefined reserved words defined by the programmaing
language.
>> every programming languages have its own set if keywords.
and in jvaa all the keywords are in lowercase.
some of the examples of the keyword are: static , public, final, double , int etc.

Identifiers
-----------
>> Identifiers are the keywords that are used by the programmers to identify
the elements in the program.
>> The identfiers can be classname, variables, mathodname and package name.

varaiables
----------

>> variables are the identfiers, variables are used to hold some values, and the identfiers
is used to identify the memory location of the stroed value.

datatype variable_name;
int x;

Initilization -> int x = 10;

data type 

1. primitive data types

>> primitive data type is such data type which is predefined
by the language and named by a reserved keyword.

2. non primitive datta types
>> Non primitive data types are such data types , which are
not already defined by the language and the user has to do it manually,
theere are 4 main types non primitive data types.
<>> String, arrays, class and interface.


primitive -> numeric and non numeric
numeric -> integer, floating point -> long ,  int , byte , short, double, float etc.
non numeric -> char, boolean



non-primitive -> class , interfaces.

1 byte = 8 bits -> 2 nibble
i nibble = 4 bits

operators
---------

operators are used in java to build the expressions, or to perform the operations.

type of opetartions
-------------------
1. relational operator -> <>, <=, >= , != , == 
2. arethemetic operator -> +, -, *, /, %
3. logical operator -> || , && 
4. Bitwise operator (| , &)
5. unary operator -> ++, --

Control statements
-------------------
>> control stattements are used to divert the flow of executions of the program in
java. and it can be acheived by using both the looping and branching of statements.

Branching refers the use of if, else, if else, nested if and switch statements.
and looping refers the forloop, foreach loop, while and do while  statements.

Methods
---------

>> methhods are the set of instructons written by the user to perform some task.
one of the advantages of methods over unstructured programmig is that it helps
to acheive the code reusability and increase the modularity of the program.
